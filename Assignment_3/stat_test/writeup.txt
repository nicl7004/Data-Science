My approach to this problem was to start with t-tests first, and then move on to bi-grams.

The hardest part of bi-grams for me was setting up our contingency table of observed and expected.
I was not familiar with matrices in python, so it took a bit of tinkering with the interpreter to make sure I got the row/column values correct.

After the contingency table it was smooth sailing.

The updated test file broke my ttest.  I noticed the first time through that the only way to pass was to double square variance, which confused me.

Something strange that I am getting when printing(max(bf._bigramCount)) is "zooming, again"
This is an interesting output for the key to the most common bigram.

In terms of what is missing: I believe that there may be some common words missing, particularly if they come at the beginning or end of the sentence.
