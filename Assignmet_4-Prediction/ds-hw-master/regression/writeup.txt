Approach:
  My approach to this problem was to research the number of Walmarts per million people in each state, and then use that as a predictor of more conservative states.
  In order to do this I went online and found my data at http://www.statemaster.com/graph/lif_wal_sto_num_of_sup_percap-stores-number-supercenters-per-capita, and
  found all the data I needed.

  An additional feature that I added was tobacco sales per capita by state.  Similar to the walmart feature more tobacco sales tend to correlate with more conservative states.
  All data on tobacco sales was found at http://libraries.ucsd.edu/ssds/pub/CTS/tobacco/sales/


Implementation:
  Walmart:
  I put all of the data I found into walmart.csv, and then proceeded to clean it with walmart.py.  Using techniques from assignment 1 and the begining of class I was able to
  create walmart_data, a table that contained the state ABBREVIATION as well as the number of walmarts per million in that state.
  After scrubbing my data, it was time to add it as a feature in predict.py.  I did this by appending it as a column to all_data prior to all_data being split into test and train.

  all_data = walmart_data.merge(all_data, on="STATE",how='left')  This is the line I used to join the walmart data with all data

  Tobacco:
  All tobacco information is stored in tobacco_sales.csv, and the function filterTobacco(file) (pun intended) is located in tobacco.py where I created a new dataframe to be added
  to all of the other data.  Given in the tobacco_sales.csv are all packs per adult for each month of a given year.  Some of the information this data provided was irrelevant, we do not
  care about the number of packs per adult in NY in 1989.  To account for this I accessed the latest month of the latest year recored for each state, and this produced more relevant information.


Result:
  As can be seen in my pred.txt and my pred-orig.txt, the addition of walmarts per capita had an effect on the numbers for each state.  The state with highest walmart per capita
  (AK) can be seen to have a large increase in our new pred.txt in comparison to our old pred.txt.  A similar result occured when adding in the smoking per capita feature.  The original
  prediction can be seen in pred-orig.txt, the prediction with only the walmart feature(not the tobacco feature) can be found in pred-wal.txt, and the prediction with both features can
  be found in pred.txt
